            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
            <li>2 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon ground turmeric</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:-</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. 
                Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.
                 Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. </li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan. </li>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. </li>
            <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish. </li>
        </ol>
